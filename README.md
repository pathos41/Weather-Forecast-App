# Weather-Forecast-App

A simple weather app with map, weather and time zone information.

Used OpenWeatherMap, MapQuest, Dark Sky, TimeZoneDB as data resources.

trigger function, page element animation using jQuery selector and Ajax to request external data services.

Perfected page view using Google Fonts and imported Skycons to add animated weather glyphs updating effects.
